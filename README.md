Loader component for your Canvas Apps! So you don't have to use loading.io or timer controls ðŸ˜Š

A simple component built using two controls - an image control and a label control. The image control is where all the SVG code is and where all the magic happens.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using built-in timer controls to animate your objects however this is a very easy way to rack up the number of controls in your application which can drastically impact its loading time (no pun intended!), especially when you're connecting to a number of data sources.

SVGs are written in XML meaning that they are incredibly small in size, even with all the animations included, and you can freely use as many as you like across your screens without affecting the total size of your app.

The component has a couple of very simple properties:

â—» SVGLoaderType â€“ there are in total 7 loaders within the component. Type in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or Bonus to reveal your fancy loader!

â—¼ SVGColour â€“ this is the colour of the SVG (excluding the bonus SVG). Please note this is a HEX value and you do not need to include the #

â—» TextVisible â€“ boolean property setting the visibility of the 'Loading' label,

â—¼ TextLabelSize â€“ font size of the 'Loading' label

â—» TextLabelColour â€“ colour of the 'Loading' label
